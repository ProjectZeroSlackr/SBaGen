Overview:
SBaGen
- SBaGen is a port of a utility of the same name.
- Directly from the original website:
 "SBaGen -- Binaural Beat Brain Wave Experimenter's Lab
  The theory behind binaural beats is that if you apply
  slightly different frequency sine waves to each ear, a
  beating affect is created in the brain itself, due to the
  brain's internal wiring. If, in the presence of these
  tones, you relax and let your mind go, your mind will
  naturally synchronize with the beat frequency. In this way
  it is possible to tune the frequency of your brain waves
  to particular frequencies that you have selected, using
  of the four bands: Delta: deep sleep, Theta: dreaming and
  intuitive stuff, Alpha: awake, focussed inside, and Beta:
  awake, focussed outside.
  So, SBAGEN is my utility, released as free software (under
  the GNU General Public Licence) for Linux, Windows, DOS and
  Mac OS X, that generates binaural tones in real-time
  according to a 24-hour programmed sequence read from a file.

- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binaural_beats

Usage:
- FastLaunch through "Media > SBaGen > FastLaunch"
  to start the "basics/prog-chakras-1.sbg" beat or
  use "Media > SBaGen > Beats" to select a beat to play.
- Files with a ".sbg" extension have their default
  action set to SBaGen.
- Toggle the "Media > SBaGen > Toggle Backlight" setting
  to set backlight on/off.
- Press forward/rewind to adjust volume and press menu/centre
  to exit SBaGen. Due to how SBaGen's main loop works, the
  response to the button presses sometimes isn't immediate
  and there may be a few seconds of delay.
- Neither the author (Jim Peters) nor I (Keripo) will
  take any responsibilities in your actions;
  USE AND EXPERIMENT WITH THIS UTILITY AT YOUR OWN RISK!
